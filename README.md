# SETech Messaging
A simple and flexible message bus implementation for .NET inspired by Microsoft Azure.

## Work In Progress
Initially planned features have been implemented and all tests are passing. However, this project needs to be tested in a real-world application to ensure that there haven't been any omissions of important features, and also so that the API can be tweaked to make this library as simple-to-use and useful as possible.

Until an official release is made, the current API is subject to change without notice.

The code has extensive documentation comments, but there are no getting started guides as of now. This should change after an official release once the API is finalized.
